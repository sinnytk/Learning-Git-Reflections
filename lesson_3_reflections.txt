When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In order to share my work with others or perhaps shift machines to keep my work online and have it on easy access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually is a good alternative to automation as we know what we're going to update our source code with.
